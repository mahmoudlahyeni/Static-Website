            <h2> Mammals</h2>
            <article>Mammals are warm-blooded animals characterized by their fur or hair and the presence of mammary
                glands that produce milk for their young. They give birth to live young (except for monotremes like the
                platypus, which lay eggs) and exhibit a wide range of sizes and habitats, from tiny bats to massive
                whales. Mammals play vital roles in ecosystems, serving as predators, prey, pollinators, and seed
                dispersers.</article>

        <h2>Birds</h2>
        <article>Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by their feathers, beaks, and lightweight skeletons,
            which enable flight. They lay eggs and are found in nearly every habitat on Earth, from dense forests to
            open oceans. Birds possess a unique respiratory system that allows for efficient oxygen exchange, essential
            for their high-energy lifestyle.</article>

        <h2>Reptiles</h2>
        <article>Reptiles are cold-blooded vertebrates that include snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodilians, and more.
            They are characterized by their scaly skin, which helps prevent water loss, making them well-suited for a
            variety of habitats, including deserts, forests, and aquatic environments. Reptiles lay eggs (though some
            give birth to live young) and breathe air through lungs. They have a unique way of regulating their body
            temperature by basking in the sun or seeking shade.</article>

            <h2> Amphibians</h2>
            <div class="overflow-content">
                Frogs and toads are amphibians. They can live both in water and on land.
                Amphibians usually undergo a metamorphic life cycle. They start as eggs, often laid in water, hatch into
                larvae (like tadpoles), and then transform into adult forms that can live on land.
